# Athlete Events Analysis
#

Using Python and its packages in order to analyse Athlete Events.

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** `3.8.6`

**Packages:** `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn` 

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/120-years-of-olympic-history

## Data Cleaning
After loading the data, I needed to clean it up a bit. I made the following changes:
* checked for any null values and replaced them with respective means,
* replaced null values in 'Medal' column with 'None' which represents 'no medal'

## EDA

Some of the insights were about finding out:
* The top countries that received the most medals in 21st century,
* Best 5 Teams in the 5 timestamps,
* Best two Teams that have received the most medals,
* The trend of the number of paricipants,
* 'age' vs 'medals won' relation,
* Likelihood regarding tall people winning a medal vs not tall people winning it,
* Sports that short people do,
* The number of medals won by tall people in %,
* The 5 surnames of families that won the most medals
